How this game works:
The game takes place on a grid simulating human body. Human organs have to protect vital organs from attacking viruses for a certain amount of time. Each organ has its unique capabilities, dealing various damage in a certain range and knocking viruses back certain amount of blocks. Each organ also has its movement range, so a strategic placement of organs is also vital to the conditions for success.
