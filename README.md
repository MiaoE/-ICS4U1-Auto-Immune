The game takes place on a grid simulating human body. Human organs have to protect vital organs from attacking viruses for a certain amount of time. Each organ has its unique capabilities, dealing various damage in a certain range and knocking viruses back certain amount of blocks. Each organ also has its movement range, so a strategic placement of organs is also vital to the conditions for success.

In this game, concepts utilized include object oriented programming (e.g. inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, abstraction), simple data structures to store entities, sorting the data structure, and searching through and accessing data from the data structure.
